## 📖 Background  

Hate speech and abusive content on social media have been rising worldwide (2021–2025).  
Victims and bystanders often face **depression, anxiety, social fear, and polarization**.  
Inspired by the Buddhist tale of **Angulimala’s transformation**, this project aims to **reduce negativity online and help users rethink toxic behavior**.  


🪷 The Story Behind Angulimala

In ancient India, Angulimala was feared as a ruthless bandit who wore a necklace of fingers taken from his victims.
One day, as he pursued his next target, he encountered the Buddha. Despite Angulimala’s threats, the Buddha remained calm and compassionate.

Through their conversation, Angulimala realized the futility of hatred and violence.
He renounced his past, transformed his life, and became a devoted monk who spread peace and kindness instead of fear.
